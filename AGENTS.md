## Writing Style for blog content

Avoid common AI writing tells:

- **No "It's not X, it's Y" constructions** — e.g., "It's not a technology problem, it's an organizational problem." Rephrase or restructure.
- **Limit em dashes** — Use sparingly. Prefer periods, commas, or parentheses. One per paragraph max.
- **No "Here's the thing" or "Let's be clear"** — Filler that signals AI
- **Vary sentence structure** — AI tends toward parallel constructions. Mix it up.
