# Tombstone: A Non-Engineer's Guide to the AI Coding Frontier

## Hook
Saloon image — AI coding tools as Wild West characters at a poker table. The newcomer (you) walks in without knowing the rules but keeps winning hands.

## Thesis
The AI coding landscape in early 2026 is the Wild West. No sheriff, no rules, tools appearing and dying daily. But here's the thing: if you're NOT a traditional SWE, you might actually have an advantage — no bad habits, no "but that's not how you do it" reflexes.

## Structure

### 1. Setting the Scene: Welcome to Tombstone
- The cast of characters (tools as archetypes):
  - **Claude Code** — The gunslinger (fast, dangerous, operates alone)
  - **Cursor** — The card dealer (controls the table, knows everyone's hand)
  - **Devin** — The bounty hunter (takes the job, comes back with results... eventually)
  - **Ghostty + tmux** — The bartender & saloon (infrastructure everyone needs)
  - **Git AI** — The sheriff's ledger (who did what, accountability)
  - **MCP** — The telegraph (connects everything, unreliably)
  - **Pencil.dev** — The portrait painter (makes things look good)
  - **You** — The newcomer who shouldn't be winning, but is

### 2. My Background (Why This POV is Different)
- Not a SWE. Military career, then consulting.
- Started coding WITH AI, not before it
- Never learned to "do it the hard way" — is that a bug or a feature?
- The centaur advantage: domain expertise + AI execution

### 3. The Dependency Dilemma
- tmux: avoided it for months, now realize it's essential infrastructure
- The "minimize dependencies" instinct vs "these tools need a foundation"
- When to be minimalist vs when to invest in tooling
- The paradox: the tools that feel optional become required once your workflow depends on agents

### 4. Navigating Without a Map
- No established best practices yet
- Every week a new "game-changing" tool appears
- How to evaluate without getting shiny-object'd:
  - Does it solve a CURRENT problem?
  - Can I test it in 30 minutes?
  - Does it play nice with my existing stack?
  - Is the team/project still alive in 2 months?
- My personal Shiny Object Protocol

### 5. What I've Learned (Lessons from the Frontier)
- **The stack is unstable — and that's OK.** Everything is v0.x. Bet on patterns, not tools.
- **CLI > GUI for AI work.** GUIs add latency between thought and execution.
- **The "last 10%" is still yours.** AI handles 90% but taste, judgment, and QA are human.
- **Attribution matters.** Git AI exists because we need to know who (what) wrote what.
- **Your domain expertise IS your moat.** The engineers are learning AI. You already have the problems worth solving.

### 6. The Coming Order (Predictions)
- Standards will emerge (Git AI, MCP)
- The Wild West consolidates to 2-3 major players
- "AI-native developer" becomes a recognized role (not SWE, not PM — something new)
- The gap between "can code" and "can't code" disappears; the gap between "has taste" and "doesn't" widens

## Visual
- Main image: Isometric saloon scene (reference the NYC isometric project — meta!)
- Tool logos as character avatars sitting at a poker table
- Could use AI image gen to create (dogfooding the process)

## CTA
- "What's your Wild West stack? What tools are you betting on?"
- Link to LFG for consulting on AI-native workflows

## Meta
- Target: LinkedIn + blog
- Length: 1500-2000 words
- Tone: Personal narrative, slightly irreverent, educational
- Overlaps with: Centaur brain post (can reference/link), Dogfooding automation story
- Unique angle: NON-ENGINEER perspective. Most AI coding content is by-engineers-for-engineers.
