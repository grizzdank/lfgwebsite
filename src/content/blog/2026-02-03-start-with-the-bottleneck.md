# Start with the Bottleneck

When companies decide to implement AI, they almost always start with their most valuable people.

The CFO's financial analysis. The founder's email. The senior engineers' code review. The sales team's outreach.

This is usually wrong.

## The Hedge Fund That Automated Compliance First

A fast-growing hedge fund wanted to deploy AI across their organization. The obvious place to start: their investors. These are the people generating alpha, making decisions that move millions.

Instead, they started with back office. Compliance paperwork. Recruiting coordination. Operations reporting. Admin work.

Why? Because those bottlenecks were constraining everything else.

The fund was scaling fast. Every new position required compliance documentation. Every new hire required recruiting bandwidth. Every operational change required reporting updates. The front office could only grow as fast as the back office could process.

Automating admin work didn't directly generate returns. But it removed the constraint on the people who did.

## Find the Constraint, Not the Crown Jewel

The instinct to automate your most valuable work makes sense on the surface. That's where the dollars are. That's where the expertise is.

But it misses how work actually flows through an organization.

Most high-value work depends on lower-value work getting done first. The analyst can't start until the data is cleaned. The engineer can't ship until the PR is reviewed. The partner can't close until the proposal is formatted.

Your best people spend a shocking amount of time waiting for dependencies, chasing down information, or doing work that's beneath their pay grade because nobody else got to it.

The constraint isn't usually where the value is created. It's in the connective tissue: the handoffs, the prep work, the administrative overhead that makes value creation possible.

## Where to Look

Three questions to find your bottleneck:

**1. Where does work pile up?**

Look for queues. Inboxes that never empty. Review processes that take weeks. Approvals that sit. Wherever work accumulates, there's a constraint.

**2. What do your best people complain about?**

Not "this is hard" complaints — those are usually valuable challenges. Listen for "I can't believe I have to do this" and "I'm still waiting on..." complaints. Those point to constraints.

**3. What would change if this was instant?**

Imagine a task taking zero time instead of its current duration. Would anything else speed up? If automating X means Y can happen faster, X might be the constraint.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

The best AI implementation often looks underwhelming at first.

You automated... expense reports? You built an agent for... meeting scheduling? You're using AI for... compliance checklists?

Yes. Because those were the bottlenecks.

Unsexy work that constrains everything else is higher leverage than prestigious work that's already flowing fine. A 10x improvement on a bottleneck beats a 2x improvement on a non-bottleneck every time.

## What This Means for Your AI Strategy

Before you start automating, map your workflows. Not your org chart — your actual work.

- What are the inputs and outputs of each team?
- Where do handoffs happen?
- What dependencies create delays?
- What tasks, if instant, would unblock everything else?

The answer to "where should we deploy AI?" isn't "wherever we spend the most money." It's "wherever we're losing the most time waiting."

Your constraint isn't your most valuable work. It's usually the boring stuff that makes valuable work possible.

Start there.
