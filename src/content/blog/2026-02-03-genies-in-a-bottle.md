A [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00285-6) recently argued that AGI is already here. The evidence: LLMs pass the Turing test more often than humans do. They win gold at the International Math Olympiad. They ace PhD exams across multiple fields.

By any reasonable benchmark, the authors argue, current AI systems have general intelligence. The long-standing problem has been solved.

I'm not going to relitigate the definition of AGI. That debate is theological at this point. But I think the authors miss something important about why people keep moving the goalposts.

The benchmarks aren't wrong. They just don't capture what people actually mean when they imagine "intelligent machines."

## The Oracle Problem

The authors compare AI to the Oracle of Delphi: intelligent, useful, but only when queried. It doesn't need agency to be intelligent, they argue. Neither did the Oracle.

Slight problem: the Oracle of Delphi was actually a priestess, possibly high on volcanic fumes, whose utterances were "interpreted" by temple priests with political agendas. The intelligence behind the Oracle was deeply human and deeply agentic, just hidden behind ritual.

Using the Oracle as an example of "intelligence without agency" accidentally proves the opposite point.

## Genies, Not Gods

A better frame: current AI is a genie.

Phenomenal cosmic powers. Itty bitty... initiative.

You summon it. You make a wish. It grants the wish, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes with ironic literalism that wrecks everything. Then it goes back in the bottle until you rub the lamp again.

The genie is incredibly capable when invoked. But it doesn't have goals. It doesn't get curious. It doesn't wake up and decide to learn something new or check on a problem it was thinking about. It exists only in the moment of the wish.

This is qualitatively different from what people imagine when they think of intelligent machines. HAL 9000 had goals (problematic ones, but still). Data wanted to understand humanity. Even Clippy had initiative, annoying, unwanted initiative, but initiative nonetheless.

Current AI has none of that. It's a tool that waits.

## Why This Matters

The "is it AGI?" debate misses the point. The interesting question is: what's the shape of the gap between what we have and what we imagined?

We have systems that can:
- Solve novel math problems
- Write working code from descriptions
- Pass expert-level exams
- Generate plausible text on any topic

We don't have systems that:
- Notice something interesting unprompted
- Pursue a line of inquiry because they're curious
- Check back on a problem they were working on
- Have preferences that persist across conversations

The first list is about capability. The second is about agency.

You can argue agency isn't necessary for "intelligence," and maybe you're right by some definitions. But agency is the thing people are actually pointing at when they say current AI doesn't feel like AGI to them. The benchmarks aren't wrong. They measure the wrong thing.

## The Genie's Leverage

None of this means AI isn't useful. Genies are incredibly useful.

A good manager with a genie outperforms a hundred people working alone. You can make a wish every few seconds. You can run parallel wishes. You can wish for things that would take a human team months.

The leverage is real. The capability is real. But the relationship is also real: you're always the one rubbing the lamp. The genie never shows up and says "hey, I was thinking about your problem and I have an idea."

Maybe that changes. Maybe future AI develops something like initiative. But for now, the most productive framing is: you have an incredibly powerful tool that does exactly what you ask, nothing more, and nothing less.

Learn to make good wishes.
