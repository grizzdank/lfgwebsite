When companies want to implement AI, they almost always start with their most valuable areas.

The CFO's financial analysis. The founder's email. The senior engineers' code review. The sales team's outreach.

This is usually wrong.

## The Law Firm That Automated Intake First

Consider a growing law firm that wants to deploy AI. The obvious place to start would be their partners. These are the people winning cases, landing clients, billing $500 an hour.

Instead, they start with intake and billing. Client onboarding paperwork. Document assembly. Invoice reconciliation. Admin work.

Why? Because those bottlenecks are constraining everything else.

The firm is scaling fast. Every new client requires intake documentation. Every matter requires document prep. Every month requires billing cycles that eat associate time. The partners can only take on as much work as the back office can process.

Automating admin work doesn't directly bill hours, but it removes the bottleneck on the people who do.

## Find the Constraint, Not the Crown Jewel

The instinct to automate your most valuable work makes sense on the surface. That's where the dollars are. That's where the expertise is.

But it misses how work actually flows through an organization.

Most high-value work depends on lower-value work getting done first. The analyst can't start until the data is cleaned. The engineer can't ship until the PR is reviewed. The partner can't close until the proposal is ready.

Your best people spend a shocking amount of time waiting for dependencies, chasing down information, or doing low-leverage work because it's in the way.

The highest-leverage fix isn't usually the highest-profile work. It's the connective tissue: handoffs, prep work, admin overhead.

## Where to Look

Three questions to find your bottleneck:

**1. Where does work pile up?**

Look for queues. Inboxes that never empty. Review processes that take weeks. Approvals that sit. Wherever work accumulates, there's a constraint.

**2. What do your best people complain about?**

Not "this is hard" complaints — those are usually valuable challenges. Listen for "I can't believe I have to do this" and "I'm still waiting on..." complaints. Those point to constraints.

**3. What would change if this was instant?**

Imagine a task taking zero time instead of its current duration. Would anything else speed up? If automating X means Y can happen faster, X might be the constraint.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

The best AI implementation often looks underwhelming at first.

You automated... expense reports? You built an agent for... meeting scheduling? You're using AI for... compliance checklists?

Yes. Because those were the bottlenecks.

The mundane fix that unblocks ten things beats the impressive fix that speeds up one.

## What This Means for Your AI Strategy

Before you start automating, map your workflows. Not your org chart — your actual work.

- What are the inputs and outputs of each team?
- Where do handoffs happen?
- What dependencies create delays?
- What tasks, if instant, would unblock everything else?

Deploy AI wherever you're losing time waiting, not wherever you're spending the most money.

Your constraint isn't your most valuable work. It's usually the boring stuff that makes valuable work possible. Start there.
