[Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) ran an experiment at Wharton: MBA students with no coding experience had to build working startup prototypes in [four days](https://x.com/emollick/status/2011523783467958585) using Claude Code and other AI tools. Most had never written a line of code.

They got further in four days than previous cohorts got in a full semester.

The interesting part wasn't the AI. It was what made some students dramatically more effective than others: management skills. Not prompt engineering. Not technical knowledge. The ability to delegate clearly, evaluate output, and course-correct.

## The Delegation Equation

Mollick proposes a simple framework for when to delegate to AI:

**Delegate when:** (AI Process Time ÷ Probability of Success) < Human Baseline Time

Three variables:
- **Human Baseline Time** — how long it takes you to do the task
- **Probability of Success** — how likely the AI produces acceptable output
- **AI Process Time** — time to prompt, wait, and evaluate

A seven-hour task with 72% AI success rate and one hour to evaluate? You save three hours on average. The math works even when the AI fails sometimes, because the wins more than cover the losses.

You can shift that equation by getting better at delegation.

## Your SOPs Are Already Prompts

Every field has invented paperwork for delegation:
- Software devs write PRDs
- Film directors use shot lists
- Architects create design intent docs
- Consultants scope engagements
- The Marines have Five Paragraph Orders

These formats all encode the same thing: what's in one person's head, translated into instructions someone else can execute.

They work as AI prompts because they were always solving the delegation problem. AI just made the feedback loop faster.

If you already know how to write a clear spec, brief, or scope document, you already know how to prompt AI effectively. You don't need to learn a new skill. You need to apply one you already have.

## The Evaluation Problem

Mollick's framework assumes you can evaluate AI output.

Many people can't.

AI produces work that looks competent. Proper formatting, confident tone, reasonable structure. But "looks competent" and "is correct" are different things. A doctor can spot when AI hallucinates a drug interaction. Can your marketing team spot when AI hallucinates a market trend?

The danger isn't that AI produces bad work. It's that bad work looks exactly like good work to someone who can't tell the difference.

This is where subject matter expertise becomes non-negotiable. The expert knows what instructions to give, sees when something's wrong, and knows how to fix it. Without that, you're just accepting whatever the AI generates and hoping.

## What This Means for Organizations

The companies getting the most from AI aren't the ones with the best tools or the biggest budgets. They're the ones with:

1. **Clear processes** — documented well enough that delegation is possible
2. **Subject matter experts** — people who can evaluate AI output in their domain
3. **Management culture** — experience setting goals, giving feedback, and iterating

Technical AI skills matter less than you'd think. The MBA students in Mollick's experiment had none, and they outperformed expectations by an order of magnitude. What they had was experience managing people and projects.

AI amplifies management skills. If you're good at delegation, you get leverage. If you're bad at it, AI just generates more garbage faster.

## The Uncomfortable Implication

If management is the AI skill, then the professionals most threatened aren't the ones whose jobs AI can do. They're the ones who never learned to delegate because they always did everything themselves.

The solo expert who hoards knowledge. The senior IC who "just does it faster than explaining." The founder who can't hand off because nobody else "gets it."

AI doesn't replace these people. It routes around them. Their colleagues with clearer processes and better delegation skills will simply get more done.

The question isn't whether you should learn AI tools. It's whether you've learned to manage. Because that's the skill that actually compounds.

If your organization has the management talent but can't figure out where AI fits, [let's talk](/schedule). The gap is usually smaller than you think.
