## Mitchell Hashimoto - "My AI Adoption Journey"

**Key insight:** The bottleneck isn't AI capability — it's having a backlog of well-defined, delegatable work. "Improving my own workflows and tools so that I can have a constant stream of high quality work to delegate. Which, even without AI, is important!"

**Relevant for:**
- **Management Is the AI Skill** — Delegation requires clear specs. Mitchell's harness engineering = good management.
- **Why AI Tools Feel Like Interns** — His Step 2 (reproduce your own work) shows the learning curve. Interns need training; so do agents.
- **Enterprise AI Agents** — His "engineer the harness" principle = what vendors won't tell you (you still need good processes)

**Quotable bits:**
- "Break down sessions into separate clear, actionable tasks. Don't try to 'draw the owl' in one mega session."
- "If you give an agent a way to verify its work, it more often than not fixes its own mistakes."
- "Turn off agent desktop notifications. Context switching is very expensive."
- "Anytime you find an agent makes a mistake, you take the time to engineer a solution such that the agent never makes that mistake again."

**Who is he:** Founder of HashiCorp (Vagrant, Terraform, Vault, etc). Currently building Ghostty terminal. Credible practitioner, not a hype merchant.
